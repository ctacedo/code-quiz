Code Quiz, asks a series of questions about Javascript.  The object is to answer as many questions as possible before the timer runs out. 
Currently the timer is set to 75 sec and begins to count down when the game begins.  For every incorrect answer time will be deducted from 
the timer.  This will calculate your final score.  Using local store and a seperate html page we are able to list your highscores and delete 
from the page.  The answers to the questions will highlight when cursor goes over them.  Check it out and try to score a new highscore!
